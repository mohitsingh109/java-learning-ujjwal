### 1. Bank Transaction System (Multiple Users Transfer Money)

#### Question:
Implement a system where multiple users are transferring money between each other's accounts simultaneously. Ensure that no money is lost or duplicated during the transfers, and transactions happen atomically.

#### Requirements:
Multiple threads represent multiple users performing transactions.
Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms to prevent inconsistent states.
Make sure no deadlocks occur.

### 2. Producer-Consumer Problem (Multi-threaded Data Processing)
#### Question:
Create a system where one thread is producing data and multiple threads are consuming it. Use a queue to represent the shared data buffer, and ensure that the consumer threads wait if the buffer is empty and the producer waits if the buffer is full.

### 3. Inventory Management System
#### Question:
You are building an e-commerce system where multiple users can buy the same product. Implement a system where multiple users can attempt to purchase an item, but ensure that the inventory count never goes below zero.

#### Requirements:
Multiple threads represent users trying to purchase the same product.
Ensure that no more items are sold than are available in stock.
Use proper synchronization to avoid race conditions.

##### Solution Outline:
Synchronize the critical section where the stock count is decremented.
Handle the case when stock reaches zero.

### 4. Hotel Booking System
##### Question:
Design a hotel booking system where multiple users can book rooms concurrently. Ensure that users do not book the same room more than once, and ensure thread safety when accessing shared resources (the rooms).

#### Requirements:
Multiple users (threads) trying to book rooms.
Prevent overbooking of any room.
Ensure thread safety while booking.

#### Solution Outline:
Use a synchronized block or ReentrantLock to handle room bookings safely.
Track available rooms and prevent duplicate bookings.

### 5. Ticket Booking System
#### Question:
Design a ticket booking system where multiple users can book tickets for an event. However, the number of tickets is limited, and no more tickets should be sold once they are sold out.

#### Requirements:
Multiple threads represent users booking tickets.
Ensure thread safety when accessing the remaining ticket count.
No overbooking should occur (i.e., the number of tickets sold should not exceed the available tickets).
#### Solution Outline:
Use synchronized or a thread-safe construct like AtomicInteger to manage the remaining tickets count.
Ensure that the tickets are sold until they are sold out.

### 5. Real-time Stock Trading System
#### Question:
Build a stock trading system where multiple traders are buying and selling shares of the same stock concurrently. Each trade should be processed atomically, ensuring the total number of shares never becomes negative.

#### Requirements:
Multiple threads represent traders trying to buy or sell shares.
Ensure that no more shares are sold than are available.
Use synchronization to prevent race conditions in share count updates.
#### Solution Outline:
Use synchronized blocks or AtomicInteger to manage the share count.
Handle both buying and selling operations.
